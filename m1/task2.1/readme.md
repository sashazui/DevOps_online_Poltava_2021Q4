Part 1
1. VirtualBox is open-source software for virtualizing the x86 computing architecture. It acts as a hypervisor, creating a VM (virtual machine) where the user can run another OS (operating system). The operating system where VirtualBox runs is called the "host" OS. The operating system running in the VM is called the "guest" OS. VirtualBox supports Windows, Linux, or macOS as its host OS.
2. Main differences from hypervisiors VirtualBox:
- Snapshots of the RAM and storage that allow reverting to a prior state.
- Screenshots and screen video capture
- Mouse pointer integration, meaning automatic coupling and uncoupling of mouse cursor when moved inside and outside the virtual screen, if supported by guest operating system.
- Seamless mode â€“ the ability to run virtualized applications side by side with normal desktop applications
-Shared clipboard
-Shared folders through "guest additions" software
-etc
